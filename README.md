# Charlie-Y Portfolio site


Using Jekyll because it's not terrible and I want routing to work and lots of things can be done simply.

I will have fun setting up individual projects down the line, like little single page fun things, but until then, I'll use this and figure things out from here. Github Pages aren't bad (read: free) and thus I'll stick with them. That'll save me over a hundred a year and many headaches down the line.

### Milestones

1. Get a home page working with a simple font and style I like
2. Home page should have 4 links to 4 different lists of posts
3. Start working on posts!
